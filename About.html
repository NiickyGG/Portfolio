    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Gonzales! I am a 28-year-old male born and raised in Arizona. My passion for computers started when I was 5 or 6. My family got their first desktop, and I was ecstatic! I remember the connection was quick; unfortunately, the internet connection wasn't, haha. I spent most of my time at home on the computer, and whenever I had a chance at school, you bet I was on one as well. I started to realize that video games could be played on more than just consoles and quickly jumped into buying and building my own PC. I'm currently running a Ryzen 5950x and a 4090, just in case anyone was wondering. :] Fast forward to now, I want to be able to build a professional website I can call my own. Thank you for taking the time to read this, and feel free to <a href="./Contact.html">Contact me</a> on any of your preferred platforms.</p>
